                    <p>[15.08.2021]
                        Just having an evening walk with my friends and passing by bukit cinta near Sollat, guess what we found? A bunch of empty canned drinks thrown on the grass 😓. Seriously? Uni students/staffs? Such a disgusting and uncivilised attitude la.
                        p/s: the trash not from the guy on the bench.</p>

                    <h2>Advice from a frontliner</h2>
                    <p>Date: 15.05.2021</p>
                    <p>Hi everyone. Regarding the covid cases, as a frontliner I think I have some right to say something. 

                        Everyone is afraid of covid, I can see a lot of confessions here complaining about the cases in USM. Just frankly saying, now covid is everywhere. If you're not in USM, there are cases in your kampung as well. Do you think it's safer staying in your house? Maybe not. The risk is the same everywhere. 
                        
                        Instead of complaining, asking USM to reveal the cases, why not you start from yourself? Wear mask! Stay in your room!
                        Sanitise yourself! Three simple steps could save you from covid. 
                        
                        I have been working in hospital since the outbreak of covid. I have colleagues who were infected. Am I scared? Of course. 
                        But I know, if I protect myself well, I'm safe. 
                        
                        I'm away from home since last year, even before the government stopped us from crossing the state. I just afraid I might be the asymptomatic patient who brought the virus to my family. So I bear the consequence of staying alone here. 
                        
                        It's simple. If you can't change others, change yourself. 
                        Stay safe.</p>
